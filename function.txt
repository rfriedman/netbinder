Functions
    Functions are things that take input and produce a result.  Like when you tell your mom you are hungry
    and she makes you some pizza rolls.  You are hungry and she provides the function of making something
    to eat.  Computers are not your mom so they take special instructions.  For example if you
    want a function that takes two colors and makes another color like green it might look like this:
    
    function makeColor from yellow and blue.  Now computer programers are lazy so they made a shorter way
    to say this for example:

    makeColor("yellow","blue"); 

    start: 0.00 
    end:  4.05
